<h1> A Taxonomy of Wishes </h1>

<p>
"A Taxonomy of Wishes" consists of a series of high definition projections of skeleton like entities.  The piece was inspired by the surprising similarities seen in immature vertebrates.  Humans, chickens, and hippoes are indistinguishable in the womb.  The information used in the creation of vastly different species is nearly the same.  A wish is like a prayer in miniature, accompanies by the flick of a coin or the blowing out of a candle.  With this piece I am drawing a comparison between the the chaotic dependencies visible in nature and the sequence of events that lead from ritual, magic, and wishes."

"A Taxonomy of Wishes" consists of a series of high definition projections of skeletal entities.  The piece compares the act of wishing to conception.  The act of wishing usually involves privacy and gentle breaths and results in some small physical change in the world.  This small change may grow into something real.  The mechanisms by which this happens may be examined but are essentially mysterious.  The piece celebrates the uniqueness of each moment, each living thing and each wish.

"A Taxonomy of Wishes" consists of a high definition projections of skeletal entities and an altar-like interface.  The piece is an experiment in the reinvention of ritual and totem and questions the illusion of permanence that the digital era affords.  The participant makes a wish and blows into the altar, this causes the skeleton to flash an image for a moment before disintegrating.  A new skeleton grows from the ashes with genetic code influenced by the previous structure.  Every generation is unique and is left unrecorded, leaving each individual with their own experience.

Wishing is a sort of conjuring, a religious or mystical act born of an infantile view of reality where facts and fantasy comingle.  It is a secret activity that should be engaged in only on auspicious occasions.  Occasions like the particular alignment of planetary bodies and their relationship to the moment to our entry into the world.  A wish is like a prayer, a way of articulating our desires while acknowledging the possible existence of a wish granter.  Flipping a coin into a pool of water or blowing out candles is a ritualistic gesture that alters the physical world.
</p>
<p>
A Taxonomy of Wishes explores the ways in which our wishes manifest in the physical world.  In a similar way that a butterfly's flapping wings may cause a hurricane in a thousand years, our acts of wishing change reality in a similarly chaotic, but heirarchically dependent way.  Each wish becomes a metaphorical packet of information which acts as the seed for the creation of a tree.  Just as it's impossible to predict the landing point of a coin flipped into a fountain, it will be impossible to predict the form that each tree will take.
</p>
<p>
The piece will consist of a projection and an altar (perhaps cake-like with candles) either extending from a wall, placed on a stand, or hung from the ceiling.  The candle will be low to the ground forcing the viewer into a kneeling or supplicant state, reinforcing the prayer like quality of a wish.  As the participant blows on the 'candle' (actually a small microphone) the 'tree' will disintegrate into particulates (dust to dust) and then begin to re-form.  
</p>
<p>
The 'tree' itself will be more creature than tree.  It will undulate and gesticulte in dance-like waves.  I am considering whether to make it look more like an undersea creature, or base it more on the human spine, with protruding vertebrae and even perhaps wings.

I am exploring other permutations of the project.  In one case, 3d prints will be placed in a butterfly collection like box.  Each sculpture will be labeled with a wish.  I am also interested in using the end of one of the tentacles as a paintbrush, I will track the movements, convert it to GCode and print out the results on the makerbot.
</p>
<p>
What I find most fascinating about the things I'm generating is their complexity and natural appearance.  I am using the heirachical nature of branching systems in a couple unique ways, I'm eschewing randomness but achieving the appearance of randomness strictly through sin waves.  I am also using many more branching segments than a standard L-system would use.  
</p>

Finally...

<p>
Perhaps the universe is not structured as a series of moments strung together like film on a reel but rather as a sculpture and our experience of time is not dissimilar to a flashlight scanning the contours of that structure.  The case against free will would be obvious in the case that there is only one branch - but if there were an infinite number of branching possibilities at each moment the tree like structure of reality would be readily apparent.  We are apparently in this reality, by choice or by chance.  The beauty, tragedy and comedy of our world is all the result of our impermanent condition and the impossible odds that we are anything at all.

Wishes is a celebration of life and diversity.  While similar in many ways, each manifestation will never be reproduced exactly.  The physical act of bending and blowing connects the viewer to the work kinesthetically.  The use of bone imagery provides a surreal context - the use of bone imagery mixes the fantastic and the banal - the inside and the outside - the squishiness of life and the succulence of death - the horror of the body - and the fascination with the body - the fear of deformity - the fascination with the alien

Thank you for your time.

In common use, mandala has become a generic term for any plan, chart or geometric pattern that represents the cosmos metaphysically or symbolically, a microcosm of the universe from an enlightened perspective, i.e. that of the principle deity.

One of the striking characteristics of experimental music traditions of the last few decades has been a concerted effort to invent and implement generative strategies for musical composition in the sense that the composer is primarily responsible for the generative system’s global design rather than the primary decision-maker for the specification of constituent details. The familiar “top-down” model of the composer as the organizer of notes on a page that signify meaningful sonic events is replaced by a “bottom-up” model of the composer as system’s designer who is responsible for the organization of a generative mechanism from which the details for sonic events can emerge.
