<h3>The following notes are rough, unedited and rambling</h3><br><br>

<br><br>
  	<p>The electric grid, the telephone network, the underground pipes and avenues of transportation are the veins and neurons of a larger organism.  If you look at satellite imagery of human cities what you will see is a growing cancer.  We are ravenous, we must grow and expand and multiply, this is our biological imperative.  We are large, our brains are large, we are intelligent and we need to consume large amounts of various kinds of foods every single day.  Our will and our instinct was born in a period of extreme abundance and extreme danger.  There is safety in numbers and so we made more of us as if the act of replication was a service to god.     </p>

<p>We think we make decisions.  We think we think.  These decisions and thoughts are the product of our bodies: meat expressions of code that can be stored in a wrapper that is much smaller than what we can see.  We're fractals.  Excuse me if you've heard this one before, it's hardly an original thought.  We will all die, there are powerful forces that drive us to consume, to reproduce, to grow and to dominate.  Murder is embedded in us, we are a horribly violent species, and in this we are hardly alone.  We're perhaps more like sea otters who will rape and murder and kidnap or chimpanzees who commit infanticide and start wars.  </p>

<p>Normalcy is an illusion that requires a tremendous amount of work on the part of nature.  The universe would be too overwhelming all the time for us to even function if we weren't able to see everything as normal, to accept things, for situations to become boring.  Try to imagine the amount of work that is required for us to experience boredom.  It is monumental.  So many trillions of cells, our blood, or heart beat, the organs that filter and churn, the agreements we've made, and still we can be bored.  How remarkable.</p>

<p>And so we want things.  We 'decide' that we're going to live our lives in a certain way.  If we were to spend all of our time interrogating all of our drives and our tastes then surely there would be no time to actually LIVE.  So to live we go where the spirit takes us.  You could say we're all ideas, expressions of a thought, an attempt to apply that thought to an actual situation.  It is impossible to say right at the beginning if an idea will be good or bad or useful or not.  Some seemingly good ideas can be easily perverted, one need only look to the results of the ideologies of the 20th century.  Capitalism will merely be the last to find itself dashed upon the rocks, leaving future generations a legacy of plastic.  The earth needed plastic so it made us, and now that it has enough it's ready to scrape us off like troublesome barnacles.</p>

<p>In the same way, the ideas we have, the things we think are normal and acceptable can be perverted and manipulated and we can get used to these perversions easily and if everyone else thinks they're normal then it's only natural that we will too.  It is far too difficult and painful a thing to actually try to change anything.  It is far too difficult until the alternatives seem worse.  And so we go along, we take on the habits of those around us, we try to make ourselves a little exceptional in some way that is acceptable, these are called norms and they're quite normal, we're social creatures and it's all so inside us and so obvious that it mostly doesn't even need to be thought about.</p>

<p>These are images of the houses that swarms built.  You can see how remarkably efficient and organized they are.  There is no evidence to suggest that the creatures that built these structures had an image of the structures in their mind.  Rather it seems more likely that they followed simple behavioral rules with the structures being a result but not anything resembling an intentional goal.  This idea is born out in simulations of autonomous agenst.  Cellular automata and flocks are two standard approaches to modeling complex interactions between simple elements.  The cell and the boid know nothing of the larger patterns they generate, they are just following a simple and specific set of rules.  This concept can be expanded to include interactions across the natural world.  We can see it in the cells that make our bodies and the cities that our bodies make.  We can also see it in our thoughts.  An idea, an action, a motivation is like the average direction of a swarm of individual thoughts.  These thoughts are mostly unconscious, we take in vastly more information than we are capable of being conscious of.  So consciousness is the tip of the iceberg.</p>


----------------<br><br>
<p>My work over the last year has centered around a simple idea.  If you take a sin wave and treat it like a series of segments, or joints, where each segment is hierarchically parented to the previous joint some interesting phenomena occur.  Passing a regular sin wave down the joint chain can generate the typical sin pattern that we're all familiar with.  However, adjusting the parameters slightly immediately begins to create much more complex shapes, looping spirals and lacy filigree.</p>

<p>To get a sense of why this happens let's step back to a simpler example.  This is a joint chain laid out in a line.  If we bend all the joints an equal amount, it will twist around and become a circle.</p>

<p>A duplication, mirroring, and extending reveals lines reminiscent of magnetic fields.</p>

<p>If the joint chain scales as it rotates (each subsequent joint becomes slightly smaller) then spirals emerge.</p>

<p>The reason that the joint chain with a sin wave applied creates such unusual shapes is that unlike a regular sin wave, the hierarchical sin wave will continue twisting around until it loops back on itself, producing spirals which alternate directions.  As these joint chains are three dimensional they can rotate in different ways on different axis to produce even more interesting results.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that as we're dealing with sin waves each of these shapes will also make a tone.</p>

<p>A slightly more interesting effect occurs when the magnitude of the sin wave is multiplied by the number of the joint chain.  By increasing the magnitude along the length phase patterns begin to emerge and fractal like structures begin to appear in the time domain.  Increasing the frequency in a similar way produces similarly striking results.</p>

<p>Again we can see the result of these interactions as they are applied in different ways to different axis.</p>

<p>Things get particularly interesting when the sin waves branch to produce arbitrary tree structures.  These techniques are used regularly in the modeling of natural forms and it is striking how easy it is to simulate natural forms with a few simple high level rules.  I came across this effect in an attempt to model a snake for an animated creation scene.  It </p>

<p>June 8th, 1991 - </p>

<p>The weather is a replication of our thoughts. The happiness is possible, iminent, I love you Amber.</p>

<p>It's starting again.  There were a dozen today and soon there will be more.</p>

<p>They're called miller moths because of the dust that covers them.  The millers would return home at night covered in a dusting of flower, now there aren't really any millers.  Machines do this.  All these neighborhoods will dry up in the future, they're too expensive to maintain.  Machines took the jobs that used to require hands, and soon they will take jobs that require brains.  We'll make machines to consume the things that machines make and we won't be required anymore.</p>

<p>When I was six I woke up and felt something between my fingers, I rubbed it and squeezed it and didn't see that it was a dead moth until I woke up.  I remember remembering what it was like to be six.  I remember the magic bag in the closet and the ghost in the concrete room in the basement.  I wouldn't go there again anyway, not even now.  And I don't believe in ghosts.  The life of a moth is like those memories.  They whisper through the chilly dry air.</p>

<p>Every year they fly from the plains into the mountains to feast on wild flowers - their quest... they go and they return.  I want to go somewhere far away - I want to see something amazing and do something amazing, things that everyone else wouldn't even believe.  And I want to come back, like Gilgamesh.  I want to be immortal.</p>

<p>I often have a dream that I'm deaf and mute and kept in a small room far away from everyone else where I hallucinate that a large creature on the wall with large tentacles is flailing madly at me.  I desire to be sick and to be taken care of.  I think a little madness is the right way, the right escape from responsibility, it's like a super power.  This is what it's like to be an Indigo, ha, someone told me that's what I was.  What a curse!</p>

<p>The moths are attracted to lights.  They burn themselves and fall in piles.  I have been placing the well preserved specimens into a box with cotton to keep them protected.  I place the singed ones into another container.  The moths leave a black fluid in spots.  It's like smears of snot.  Amber said you could eat it and you would see the moon.</p>

<p>Amber Amber I'm almost sure I'm in love with Amber - she named herself, her real name is Lillith but she liked the color.  I love almost everything about her, her mind explodes - her smell, her charm, her wit and her cunning.  I think of her every second of every day - I want to be with her.  I imagine me and her doing things together, the sound of her laugh.  I picture her face, I love her.  If soulmates exist then I think I've found mine.  I hope she likes techno... :-)</p>

<p>The moths attraction to light is a mystery, but I have seen a pattern.  The power lines which feed the lights are multiplying in the plains.  In the night breezes you can hear them whistle.  At the end of the road is a church.  It's full of moon faced little haters... they stink and I think it would be funny to chop off their fingers and watch them squeal.</p>

<p>My collection is growing.  The moths are now dying in great piles.  School was cancelled because when they turned on the air conditioner moth parts flew out and clogged the filters.  Lilly was there and she laughed at me when I freaked out over a moth in my shirt.  Then everyone else laughed at me... that's the nightmare.</p>

<p>My Mother won't leave the house anymore.  It's the sound of the wind, and she doesn't drive, but the moths are too much for her, and so she stays home and talks to people on the phone, and something is different this year.  There are more of them.</p>

<p>The telephone in my house has a crossed connection.  I get phone calls and when I answer the phone I can hear the conversations of strangers.  It's a retarded couple.  Their hearts are true and they're in love and it's beautiful, how much in love in love they are.  They coo to each other and they cuddle up and it's like a rainbow of warmth and that's all I want.  I want to love... i want to be happy and ambitious and free &amp; nice &amp; good &amp; ignorant.... everyone abandoned me.... i have small stupid pleasures,... my so called hobbies &amp; doings.... those are all thats left for me.</p>

<p>Trigger is a 911 operator.  We met on a BBS, he works in the East and said that things were getting quite bad.  The sky was black, the moths piled up in doors.  I thought maybe Trigger wanted to fuck me because he sounded gay but he was also nice and I thought that maybe it was me that was the bad person for thinking such things.</p>

<p>My moth collection is too big.  People should see this work that I've done, it is beautiful and amazing but I know that nobody will and they don't deserve to anyway.  The light I feel in my heart is stuck and I want to give it all to Amber but I know that if I do it will just scare her so it's better that I save my love for someone who deserves it anyway but there's nobody out there for that.  I love her. I heard her talking to Matt, jock asshole, she was talking about the flickering lights of shadows in a cave and how if we were stuck there and that's all we knew we might mistake the shadows for the real thing.  And I wanted to be able to talk about things like that but when I open my mouth all that comes out are farting frog sounds.</p>

<p>And the sky separated from blackness and from the blackness ashes and from the ashes moths.  Fuck fuck.  I'm surrounded by assholes trying to stuff Jesus down my throat.  I'm going to hell anyway, maybe I should deserve it.</p>

<p>I remember the first time sperm came out when I masturbated.  There was snow on the ground and everything became magical.  They talked about that in school like it was a disease.  I was still surprised though when it actually happened.  Now I do it too much.  Im forever sorry, infinitely, about the pornos. My humanity has a foot fetish, &amp; bondage exteme liking. i try to thwart it, sometimes to no effect, Yet the masturbation has to stop. I'm sorry Always. I feel the happiness here, thinking of her, for brief moments. Thats how i know the everything is true.</p>

<p>Today we got stuck in traffic on the way to the mall.  There was an accident and when we opened the car door a moth got inside.  We didn't want to kill it because they're messy and it flew around inside, flapping against the glass.  Finally someone came along and told us we had to hide because a tornado was coming.  The air changed and a siren went off.  Everyone was running from their cars and falling over into ditches.  The tornado swept over us and left piles of wood and strips of waving silver.  This was my dream.</p>

<p>Today I told Amber that I want to be her boyfriend.  I said it just like that.  My frog voice, my frog throat.  There are kings of frogs in the reeds but the one I have is just a sad toad.</p>

<p>Today I threw my B grade moths out into the back yard.  I'm keeping the ones that are nice, but the singed ones will never be worth anything.  There are too many.  I can hear them at night, like whispers.</p>

<p>The power went out today in the lightning storm.  The moths left us alone for a little while.  They can love, why can't i? The true existence lives in solitude, always aware, always infinite, always, looking, for, his love. Peace might be the ultimate destination... destination unknown... i want happiness. Abandonment is present for the martyr. my thoughts exist in, want to exist live in. I want to find a room in the great hall and stay there with my love forever. sadness seems infinite, &amp; the shell of happiness shines around. Yet the true despair overcomes it this lifetime. How tragic too my </p>

<p>FUCKIN DUMASS SHITHEAD
I HATE SHIT motherfuckin
goddam piece of death
thought and nothin
        FUCK
FUCK
                    FUCK!</p>

<p>Some of the moths in my collection are becoming spongy, they're starting to grow some bits of furry stuff.  It looks like mold but smaller.  I'm not sure if I should throw them out.  I thought I should taste one and then stuff my body full of them.  Maybe the poison would grow inside me too and I would become powerful, and then I could do the thing I know that I will have to do.</p>

<p>The meanest trick was played on me - a fake love... She in reality doesn't give a good fuck about me... doesn't even know me..... I have no happiness, no ambitions, no friends, &amp; no LOVE!!! [Edited] can get me that gun I hope, I wanna use it on a poor S.O.B. </p>

<p>They're installing some new telephone poles in the field near my house it looks like, some small ones, in patches.  Some dickwad told me to stop fucking with the electrical box.  I just wanted to see the lights too.  I want to see the light that the moth sees.  It must be beautiful.</p>

<p>The sun didn't even come out today.  The telephone poles are growing in the basement where my moths were.  I hate everything. why can't I die... not fair. I want pure bliss... to be cuddling with Amber, who i think i love deeper than ever... I was hollow, thought I was right. Another form of the Downward Spiral... deeper &amp; deeper it goes. to cuddle w. her, to be one w. her, to love; just laying there. I need a gun. This is a wierd entry... I should feel happy. The neighbors have left.  I haven't even seen my Mom.  </p>

<p>Existence..... what a strange word. He, set out by determination &amp; curiosity, knows no existence, knows nothing realevent to himself. The petty destinations of others &amp; everything on this world, in this world, he knows the answers to. Yet they have no purpose to him. He seeks knowledge of the unthinkable, of the indefineable, of the unknown. He explores the everything...using his mind, the most powerful tool known to him. Not a physical barrier blocking the limits of exploration, time thru thought thru dimensions.... the everything is his realm. Yet, the more he thinks, hoping to find answers to his questions, the more come up. Amazingly, the petty things mean much to him at this time, how he wants to be normal, not this transceiver of the everything. Then, ocuring to him, the answer. How everything is connected yet seperate. By experiencing the petty others' actions, reactions, emotions, doings, [scribble] and thoughts, he gets a mental picture of what, in his mind, is a cycle. Existence is a great hall, life is one of the [scribble] rooms, death is passing thru the doors, &amp; the ever-existant compulsion of everything is the curiosity to keep moving down the hall, thru the doors, exploring rooms, down this never-ending hall. Questions make answers, answers conceive questions, and at long last he is content. </p>

<p>I start with a random collection of balls and I start my turtle going in a random direction.  The turtle moves in the average direction of the balls it can see, this will drag it close and closer to the edge of the balls.</p>

<p>Yo.... whassup... heehehehe...Know what's whi wierd? Everyone knows everyone. I swear, like im an outcast, &amp; everyone is conspiring against me.... Check it... (this isn't good, but i need to write, so here....)</p>

<p>Within the known limits of time... within the conceived boundaries of space... the average human thinks these are the settings of existence... Yet the ponderer, the outkast, the believer, helps out the human. "Think not of 2 dimensions" says the ponderer, "But of 3, as your world is conceived of 3 dimensions, so is mine. While you explore the immediate physical boundaries of your body, you see in your 3 dimensions - L, W, &amp; H. Yet I, who is more mentally open to anything, see my 3 dimensions, my realm of thought - Time, Space, &amp; THOUGHT. Thought is the most powerful thing that exists - anything conceivable can be produced, anything &amp; everything is possible, even in your physical world." After this so called "lecture" the common man feels confused, empty, &amp; unaware. Yet, those are the best emotions of a ponderer. The real difference is, a true ponderer will explore these emotions &amp; what caused them.
Another... a dream.</p>

<pre><code>Miles &amp; miles of never-ending grass, like a wheat. A farm, sunshine, a happy feeling in the presence, Absolutely nothing wrong, nothing ever is, contrary 180° to normal life. No awareness, just pure bliss, unexplainable bliss, The only challenges are no challenge, &amp; then... [sketch of a wall] BAM!!! realization sets in, the world is the greatest punishment: life.

Hypnosis Place - It is a sky - with one large cloud, &amp; sort of a cloud-made chair - the sun is at the head of the chair... 10 oclock up into the sky.... Below, i sometimes see myst, &amp; the green (Great green) earth. sorta a city, yet I hear nothing. I relax on this chair - actually like a chaise - &amp; i am talking... to what? I don't know - it's just there, i have the feeling that i kno him, even though I consciously dont... &amp; we talk like we are the same person - like hes my soul....
</code></pre>

<p>[sketch of a 'thought box'] The everlasting contrast....</p>

<p>Dark. Light. God. Lucifer. Heaven. Hell. GOOD. BAD. Yes, the ever-lasting contrast. Since existance has known, the 'fight' between good &amp; evil has continued. Obviously, this fight can never end. Good things turn bad, bad things become good, the 'people' on the earth see it as a battle they can win. HA fuckin morons. If people looked at History, they would see what happens. I think, too much, I understand, I am GOD compared to some of these un-existable, brainless zombies. Yet, the actions of them interest me, like a kid w. a new toy. Another contrast, more of a paradox, actually, like the advanced go for the undevelopeds realm, while some of the morons become everything dwellers - but, exceptions to every rule, &amp; this is a BIG exception - most morons never change - they never decide to live in the 'everything' frame of mind.

<p>OH My God..... I am almost sure I am in love... w. [edited]. Hehehe... such asta a strange name, like mine... Yet everything about her I love. From her good body to her almost perfect face, her charm, her wit, &amp; cunning, her NOT Being popular, Her friends (who I know) -some - I just hope she likes me as much as I L♥ LO♥E Her. I think of her every second of every day, I want to be with her, I imagine me &amp; her doing things together, the sound of her laugh, I picture her face, I love her. If solmates soulmates exist, then I think I've found one mine. I hope she likes Techno.... :-)</p>

<p>oooh god i want to die sooo bad... such a sad, desolate, lonely, unsalvageable i feel i am..... not fair, NOT FAIR!!!! I wanted happiness!! I never got it... let's sum up my life... the most miserable existence in the history of time.... My best friend has ditched me forever, lost in bettering himself, &amp; having/enjoying/ taking for granted his love.... Ive NEVER knew this... not 100 times near this... they look at me [edited] like i'm a stranger;... I helped them both out thru life, &amp; they left me in the abyss of suffering when i gave them the boost out. The one who I thought was my true love, [edited], is not. Just a shell of what I want the most... The meanest trick was played on me - a fake love... She in reality doesn't give a good fuck about me... doesn't even know me..... I have no happiness, no ambitions, no friends, &amp; no LOVE!!! [Edited] can get me that gun I hope, I wanna use it on a poor S.O.B. I know... his name is vodka, dylan is his name too. What else can I do/give... i stopped the pornography. I try not to pick on people. Obviously at least one power is against me. [edited]... funny how Ive been thinking about her over the last few days... giving myself fake realities that she, others MIGHT have liked me just a Dylan Klebold's journalbit.... my bad... I have always been hated, by everyone &amp; everything, just never aware.... Goodbye all the crushes ive ever had, just shells.... images, no tu truths... BUT WHY? YeS, You can read this, why did god [incoherent scrawl]
[arrow points down to text below]</p>

<p>Me. sorry I didn't write, A SHITLOAD in my existence mist. Ok... hell &amp; back... ive been to the zombie bliss side... &amp; I hate it as much if not more than the awareness part. I'm back now.... a taste of what I thought I want... wrong. Possible girlfriends are coming then [edited].. I'll give the phony shit up in a second. want TRUE love.... I just want something i can never have.... true true I hate everything. why can't I die... not fair. I want pure bliss... to be cuddling w. [edited], who i think i love deeper than ever... I was hollow, thought I was right. Another form of the Downward Spiral... deeper &amp; deeper it goes. to cuddle w. her, to be one w. her, to love; just laying there. I need a gun. This is a wierd entry... I should feel happy, but shit brought me down. I feel terrible. [Sketch of a "thought box" labeled 'TB'] The Lost Highway apparently repeats itself. I want drink. now. [edited] lucky bastard gets a perfect soulmate, who he can admit FUCKIN SUICIDE to &amp; I get rejected for being honest about fuckin hate for jocks. From the wrong people maybe... [edited] &amp; [edited].. Anyway... heres a 2 poems...
2 FUCK 
me
Die 
me</p>

<p>Awareness signs the warrant for suffering. why is it that the zombies achieve something me wants (overdeveloped me). They can love, why can't i? The true existence lives in solitude, always aware, always infinite, always, looking, for, his love. Peace might be the ultimate destination... destination unknown... i want happiness. Abandonment is present for the martyr. my thoughts exist in, want to exist live in.

<p>Farther &amp; farther distant... That's what's happening. me &amp; everything that zombies consider real... just images, not life. Soon I will be at peace I hope..
Burn --> ♫ "with all yer life fucked up around you". ♫ I get more depressed with each day... more shit.... &amp; I CAN'T EVER STOP IT!!!! [illegible scrawl]</p>

<p>Some god i am... All people i ever might have loved have abandoned me, my parents piss me off &amp; hate me... want me to have fuckin ambition!! How can i when i get screwed &amp; destroyed By everything??!!!! I have no money, no happiness, no friends... Eric will be getting farther away soon... I'll have less than nothing... how normal. I wanted to love... i wanted to be happy and ambitious and free &amp; nice &amp; good &amp; ignorant.... everyone abandoned me.... i have small stupid pleasures,... my so called hobbies &amp; doings.... those are all thats left for me. &lt; clinging onto the smallest rocks... many people climbing up a never-ending vertical cliff.... [edited] &amp; [edited] found a plateau to exist on....they walked up me to get to it. Nobody will help me... only exist w. me if it suits them. i helped, why cant they? [edited] will get me a gun, ill go on my killing spree against anyone I want. more crazy...deeper in the spiral, lost highway repeating, dwelling on the beautiful past, ([edited] &amp; [edited] gettin drunk) w. me, everyone moves up i always stayed. Abandonment. this room sux. wanna die.</p>

<p>everything is as least expected. The meak are trampled on, the assholes prevail, the gods are decieving, lost in my little insane asylum w. the outhouse redneck music playing... wanna die &amp; be free w. my love... if she even exists. She probably hates me... finds a [illegible] or a jock who treats her like shit. I remember details... nothing worth remembering i remember. I don't know my love: could be [edited], or [edited], or [edited], or [edited], or anyone. I don't know &amp; im sick of not KNOWING!! to be kept in the dark is a punishment!!! 
I have lost my emotions... like in hurt the song. NIN. People eventually find happiness. i never will. Does that make me a non-human? YES. the god of sadness... [edited] church was so fun.... the rec thing w. marc...</p>

<p>Well well...so much changes... (like ..existence). I understand almost everything now... so close to my love - [edited]. The runes have shown it, she has shown it, i have felt it. I know the meaning of each life: To be loved by yer love, &amp; to be happy with ones self. Dylan Klebold's thought boxOnly for the gods though (me, [edited] &amp; etc.) The zombies &amp; their society band together &amp; try to destroy what is superior &amp; what they don't understand &amp; are afraid of. Soon... either ill commit suicide, or I'll get w. [edited] &amp; it will be NBK for us. My hapiness. her hapiness. NOTHING else matters. Ive been caught w. most of my crimes -- xpl drinking, smoking, &amp; the house vandalism &amp; the pipe bombs. If by fate's choice, [edited] didn't love me, id slit my wrist &amp; blow up atlanta strapped to my neck. It's good, understanding. a hard road since my realization, but it gets easier. BUT IT DOESNT! That's part of existence. Unpredictable. Existence is pure hell &amp; pure heaven at the same time. I will never stop wondering, the lost highway will never end, the music in my head will never stop...It's all part of existence. The hall will never end. The love will always be here. GOD
I LOVE HER!!! It's so great to love.</p>

<p>society is tightening it's grip on me, &amp; soon I &amp; [edited] will snap, he will have on revenge on society, &amp; then be free, to exist in a timeless sourceless place of pure hapiness. The purpose of life is to be happy &amp; be with yer love who is equally happy. Not much more to say. goodbye.</p>

<p>Dylan Klebold's drawing of the lost highway</p>

<p>I love
   her, &amp; she loves
       me.     Almost happiness in
slavery -- the real people (gods)
are slaves to the majority
of zombies, but we know
&amp; love being superior.</p>

<p>I didnt want to
be a jock... i hated
The hapiness
that they
have - &amp; I will
have something
infinitely
better...</p>

<p>(By the way, some zombies are smarter than others,
some manipulate... like my parents.)
I am God. [edited] is God.
&amp; zombies will pay for
their arrogance, hate, fear, abandonment, &amp;
distrust.</p>

<p>I LOVE YOU [edited] Thats all I think about anymore... I know that this humanity is almost done. that we will be free. Dylan Klebold's thought boxWe have proven to fate that we are the everything of purity &amp; halcyon, &amp; that we deserve, need, love, cant exist w/o each other. its bad i think that i might not be enough, my mind sometimes gets stuck on its own things, i think about human things. All i try to do is imagine the happiness between us. that is something we cannot even concieve in the toilet earth. The everything, the halcyon, the happiness is ours. There will be no notes from me. Let the humans suffer w/o my knowledge of the everything.I am trying not to think about the happiness, somehow thinking that [Dylan's sign for "fate"] will destroy it if i concieve/relish in it when I'm a human. But i love her. we are soulmates. </p>

<p>You don't consciously know who I am, &amp; doubtedly unconsciously too. I, who write this, love you beyond infinice. I think about you all the time, how this world would be a better place If you loved me as I do you. I know what you're thinking: "(some psycho wrote me this harassing letter)" I hoped we could have been together... you seem a lot like me. Pensive, quiet, an observer, not wanting what is offered here (school, life, etc.) You almost seem lonely, like me. You probably have a boyfriend, though, &amp; might have not given this note another thought. I have thought you my true love for a long time now, but... well... there was hesitation. You see I can't tell if you think of anyone as I do you, &amp; if you did who that would be. Fate put me in need of you, yet this Earth blocked that with uncertainties. I will go away soon, but I just had to write this to you, the the one I truly loved. Please, for my sake, dont tell anyone about this, as it was only meant for you. Also, please don't feel any guilt about my soon-to-be "absense" of this world. [arrow points to a note in the margin that reads: "It is solely my decision: nobody else's."] Oh... the the thoughts of w us... doing everything together, not necessarily anything, just to be together would have been pure heaven heaven. I guess it's Time time to tell you who I am. I was in a class with you 1st semester, &amp; was blessed w. being with you in a report. I still remember your laugh. Innocent, beautiful, pure. This semester I still see you rarely. I am entranced during 5th period, as we both have it off. To most people, I appear.. well... almost scary, but that's who I appear to be as people are afraid of what they don't understand. I denied who I was for a long time. until high school...
Anyway, you have noticed me a few times, I catch every one of these gazes w. an open heart. I think you know who I am by now. Unfortunately... you even if you did like me even the slightest bit, you would hate hate me if you knew who I was. I am a criminal, I have done things that almost nobody would even think about condoning. The reas reason that I'm writing you now is that I have been caught for the crimes I comitted, &amp; I went want to go to a new existence. You know what I mean. (Suicide) I have have nothing to live for, &amp; I won't be able to survive in this world after this legal conviction. However However, if it was true that you loved me as I do you,... I would find a way to survive. Anything to be with you. [arrow points to margin where Dylan writes: I would enjoy life knowing that you loved me.] 99/100 chances you prob. think I'm crazy, &amp; want to stay as far away as possible. If that's the case, then I'm very sorry for involving an innocent person in my problems, &amp; please don't think twice. However, If you are are who I hoped for in my dreams dreams &amp; realities realities, then do me this a favor: Leave Leave a piece of paper in my locker, [arrow to margin note reading: "Locker #837 -- combo=19-37-9 --near the library"] saying anything that comes to you. Well, I guees guess this is it-- goodbye &amp; I love(d) you.</p>

<p>I LOVE [edited]!!</p>

<p>I love her to infinince. I look back on my awareness journey, see the parts &amp; sections of my understanding... its almost done, yet it is never done, I love [edited], she is my soulmate, my love, all the imaginative halcyons &amp; pure existences I have with her (to me) are almost happiness... I just wish I could call her... something blocks me from calling her my human side is putting up a wall, to prevent me from calling her, like a few of "its" truth. BS. I will overcome all fears, doubts, &amp; zombie-based thoughts (oxymoron)... I will follow our hearts, to the halcyon, loving her. I love you [edited] </p>

<p>1.5 human years.... so much changed in small time, my friends (at my choice) are Sketch of fate by Dylan Klebolddepleting &amp; collapsing under each other (Eric &amp; [edited]) like i thought they would. I am ready to be w. [edited]. The ups &amp; downs of fate are forever, good &amp; bad, equal. me. [tri-tier cross] the lost highway, &amp; downward spiral never end. existence is like infinity times itself. ∞ ∞ I have passed thru this much of the ever existence. this is almost a checkpoint. The zombies have set their place in my mind. for the cliff theory, Ive jumped off w. [arrow down to] [edited] &amp; we've floated away to the halcyon. the zombies will pay for their being, their nature. I know everything, yet I know nothing. I am a true god. my infinite memories, thoughts, Dylan Klebold's thought boxperceivations of purity come a lot more w. her, there is pure pure hapiness -- the pupo purpose of our our existence. I hate, love things. hate everything, love me &amp; [edited]. I understand that i can never ever be a zombie, even if i wanted to. the nature of my entity.. Soon we will live in the halcyons of our minds, the one thing that made me a god. Things are so simple, now that they are infinitely complicated. HAHAHAHA </p>

<p>Dylan's lost highway    I UNDERSTAND</p>

<p>THE EVERYTHING</p>

<p>I AM THE GOD </p>

<p>OF THE EVERYTHING </p>

<p>W. [edited]</p>

<p>Fate is my only master</p>

<p>This is prob. my last 
entry. [line points to "I will never stop learning."] i love my
self, close second to 
[edited], my everlasting 
love. Goodbye, </p>

<p>This Shit</p>

<p>This shit again. back at writing doing just like a fucking zombie. Lately I cant change my mind from the fucking deeds of zombies. Earth, humanity, HERE. thats mostly what I think about. I hate it. I want to be free.... free... I thought it would have been time by now. the pain multiplies infinitely. never stops. (yet(¿?) im here, STILL alone, still in pain. so is she. The thing i have concluded is that fate will decide when we should be together.  Decided when our existence started, it should end the same way, with us unknowing, in limbo. I love you [edited]. Always have, will. The scenarios, images, pieces of happiness still come. They always will. I love her. she loves me. i know she is tired of suffering as i am. it is time. it is time. I love her. the journey, the endless journey, started it has to end. we need to be happy to exist timely. I see her in perfection, the halcyons. love it, endless purity. i exist as a less than nothing w/o her -O.
my humanity, -O. I dont know if I should call her, or wait for f to act. Yet, calling her is a state of humanity. Im forever sorry, infinitely, about the pornos. My humanity has a foot fetish, &amp; bondage exteme liking. i try to thwart it, sometimes to no effect, Yet the masturbation has stopped. I'm sorry [edited] Always. I feel the happiness here, thinking of her, for brief moments. Thats how i know the everything is true.</p>

<p>[written beside a few hearts and the words: I LOVE YOU]
I hate this non-thinking stasis. Im stuck in humanity. maybe going "NBK" (gawd) w. eric is the way to break free. i hate this. 
[heart with small Love you]</p>

<p>The weather is a replication of our thoughts. The happiness is possible, iminent, I love you [edited].</p>

<p>DK + ??
The happiness is close,
visible, ending, end of
the beginning of the
halcyons.</p>

<p>Dylan Klebold drawings
The humanity is blocking me again. Time to go. Hahahaha fuck all. hate this shit need to be me. We, I love her</p>

<p>The framework of society stands above &amp; below me. The hardest thing to destroy, yet the weakest thing that exists. I know that i am different, yet i am afraid to tell the society. The possible abandonment, persecution is not something I want to face, yet it is so primitive to me. I guess being yourself means letting people know about inner thoughts too, not just opinions &amp; fashions. (Heheh) I will be free one day, in the land of purity &amp; my happiness, I will have a love, someone who is me in a way. Someday... Possibly thru this life, maybe another, but it will happen... </p>

<p>Love is more valuable than anything I know. To love is to enter a completion of one's self. I hate those who choose to destroy a love, who take it for granted. love is greater than life even. As i look for love, i feel i can't find it. ever. but something tells me i will. Someday. Somewhere. As my love will find me. She feels as i do right now, i can feel it. we will be inseperable. Her &amp; i. Whether it is [edited] or not, i think ill find it. (my love). we will be free, to explore the vast wonders of the stars. To cascade down everlong waterfalls, &amp; thru the warmest seas of pure happiness... no limits... no limits. Nothing will stop us. </p>
