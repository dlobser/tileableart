			Hello, I am David Lobser, president of Parametric Hotel Art or PHA.  Come with me as I take you through a journey into art
			and hotels.  <br><br>It was nearly one hundred years that Picasso and
			Braque discovered cubism, a procedural way of fragmenting the
			image plane.  At the time such experimentation was considered ugly and
			disturbing, but over the course of the next half century the ideas
			were developed to the point of being merely another decorative style.
			We at generative hotel art understand the importance of decor and it's
			impact on the paying customer.  Good hotel art should be inoffensive, soothing, sophisticated and beautiful.  Most
			hotels rely on prints of master works from previous centuries. At PHA
			we understand how your patrons think.  A one of a kind hand painted
			piece says money and power in ways that mere prints cannot.
			<br><br>
			We use sophisticated computer technology to deconstruct the rules of
			various schools of abstract art and have come up with a method for
			inventing new, virtual artists.  These artists will spend an evening
			generating hundreds or thousands of works which our experts choose the
			best.  The designs use algorithms which can produce imagery that
			humans are well attuned to appreciating.  The aspects of this work
			include repetition on different scales, rhythmic alternations, and
			fluid, graceful strokes.  These are then sent to our factory where
			they are painted by machines of loving grace.
